# Auto File Organizer

This is a simple Python project that helps organize files in a folder automatically. It moves files into different folders based on their type, like Images, Videos, Documents, Audio, Python files, and others.

## How it works
1. You set the folder you want to organize in the script (`TARGET_FOLDER` variable).  
2. Run the script.  
3. The script will create folders for each type of file and move the files into them.
